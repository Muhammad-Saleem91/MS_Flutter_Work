you can give required keyword then it will be fixed that
user will give this parameter on every cost otherwise it 
will show error */

/*Method two : We will use nullable datatype and 
Null Safety Operator (?,!) => Null check operator

but if we dont give any thing to the number which dont define
if we are confirmed that in every case it will give parameter and not null
then we can use "!" after using that variable but if we are not confirmed that
it will give parameter than we will use "??" Null aware 
it will check that if value is null than it will use the value after ?? operator*/
