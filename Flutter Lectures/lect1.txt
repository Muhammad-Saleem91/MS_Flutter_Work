two types of classes 
statelesss ==> state which does not change anything
statefull ==> state which changes on clicks

Stateless Widgets:


important things to keep in mind:
==> material design widgets (used for both ios and andriod)
we get all the widgets from Material Design therefore we will return MaterialApp() widget in our initial class

==> cubertino design for sometimes used for ios

for complete screen we will use scaffold widget
when we are design complete design then we will use scaffold widget


sizedBox is used for spacing 
container is used for decoration and for displaying text

we use mainAxisAlignment(MA) and crossAxisAlignment(CA) is used for Alignments 

Column 
-MA(top to Bottom)
-CA(left to Right)

Row
-MA(left to right)
-CA(top to bottom)
